2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
4 out of 142 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: DA2dat1_0, DA2dat2_0, DA2sclk_0, DA2sync_0.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer je_pin4_iobuf/IBUF (in je_pin4_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/DA2Pmod_0/inst/DA2Pmod_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/DA2Pmod_0/inst/DA2Pmod_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/DA2Pmod_0/inst/DA2Pmod_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
